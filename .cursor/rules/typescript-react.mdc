# TypeScript & React Standards

- Prefer explicit types for exports and public APIs. Avoid `any`; minimize `unknown`.
- Use meaningful variable and function names; avoid abbreviations.
- Use early returns and shallow nesting where possible; avoid unnecessary try/catch.
- Only add comments when non-obvious, architectural, or security/performance relevant.
- Follow existing formatting; do not reformat unrelated code.
- For UI links to external sites, always add `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
- In tests: use `*.{spec,test}.ts(x)` with correct environment; keep tests deterministic.

## Next.js App Router

- Place route handlers under `src/app/**/route.ts`.
- Keep server-only logic in route handlers or server files; avoid leaking into client components.
- Co-locate component styles and small utilities near usage when reasonable.
