# Liquidium Foundation – Terms of Use

_Last Updated: September 23, 2025_

> **Restricted Territories Notice**  
> USE OF THE FOUNDATION FUNCTIONS OF THE SITE BY PERSONS WHO ARE CURRENTLY OR ORDINARILY LOCATED OR RESIDE IN **RESTRICTED TERRITORIES** IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED, REGARDLESS OF THE USER’S IP ADDRESS. UTILIZING A VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK OR OTHER METHOD TO CONCEAL A USER’S RESTRICTED TERRITORY RESIDENCE IS ALSO STRICTLY PROHIBITED AND MAY RESULT IN PERMANENT BLOCKING OF USE OF THE SITE IN CONNECTION WITH BLOCKCHAIN ADDRESSES SUSPECTED OF BEING TIED TO A RESTRICTED TERRITORY RESIDENCE.
> For the avoidance of doubt, the **United Kingdom** is considered a Restricted Territory. The Foundation may block, throttle, or terminate access if circumvention is suspected.

Please review these Terms of Use (“**Terms**”) carefully, as they set forth the legally binding terms and conditions that govern your use of our website located at [https://liquidium.org](https://liquidium.org) (the “**Website**”). The Website and any content, tools, features, and functionality offered on or through our Website are collectively referred to as the “**Site**”. For purposes of these Terms, “**you**” and “**your**” mean you as the user of the Site. These Terms expressly cover your rights and obligations, and our disclaimers and limitations of legal liability, relating to your use of, and access to, the Site.

The Site is a copyrighted work belonging to **Liquidium Foundation**, a Cayman Islands foundation company (the “**Foundation**,” “**us**,” “**our**,” and “**we**”). Your submission of information, including personally identifiable information or personal data (“**Personal Data**”), through or in connection with the Site is governed by the terms of our privacy policy as updated from time to time (the “**Privacy Policy**”). All such additional terms, guidelines, and rules, including our Privacy Policy, are incorporated by reference into these Terms.

---

> **Important Notice Regarding Arbitration**  
> WHEN YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS YOU ARE AGREEING (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION) TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND THE FOUNDATION THROUGH **BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION** RATHER THAN IN COURT. PLEASE REVIEW **SECTION 15 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION & ARBITRATION)** BELOW FOR DETAILS. HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF A JURISDICTION WHERE APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES, THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE IN SECTION 15 WILL NOT APPLY TO YOU BUT THE PROVISIONS OF **SECTION 16 (GOVERNING LAW)** WILL APPLY INSTEAD.

---

## 1. Agreement to Terms

**Parties; Roles.** The Site and protocol are operated by **Liquidium Foundation**, a Cayman Islands foundation company (the “**Foundation**”). Certain web interfaces and services may be provided on the Foundation’s behalf by one or more affiliated service providers (including U.S. affiliates) (collectively, “**Affiliates**” and “**Service Providers**”). References to “**Liquidium**,” “**we**,” “**us**,” or “**our**” mean the Foundation together with its Affiliates and Service Providers, as applicable. Your agreement to these Terms extends to and benefits the Foundation as well as its Affiliates and Service Providers.

By accessing and using our Site, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms, you are not authorized to use the Site.

## 2. Privacy Policy

Please review our Privacy Policy, which also governs your use of the Site, for information on how we collect, use, and share your information: [Privacy Policy](/privacy). It is strongly recommended that you review our Privacy Policy prior to using the Site. You agree that those disclosures are binding upon your use of our Site.

## 3. Services

1. **Community Governance & Staking.** The Site may enable you to vote and participate in certain community actions (e.g., submitting proposals or engaging in other decision-making processes, “**Community Governance**”). The Site may also allow you to lock (“**Stake**”) certain digital assets or tokens for a specified period (the “**Lockup Period**”). By staking, you acknowledge and agree such assets may not be available for unlocking or withdrawal until the applicable Lockup Period has ended.

2. **Transactions.** The Site may enable you to initiate and participate in transactions involving digital assets, including without limitation: (a) withdrawing tokens or other assets to a compliant non-custodial wallet (“**Withdrawals**”); and (b) exchanging one type of digital asset or token for another (“**Swapping**”).

3. **Limitations for U.S. Residents.** If you are a resident of the United States, certain features or functions of the Site may be unavailable to you, including but not limited to Withdrawals and Swapping. You may participate in Staking, Community Governance, and any other features we choose to make available to you at our sole discretion.

For the avoidance of doubt, if your jurisdiction is included within the **Restricted Territories**, you are not permitted to access or use any part of the Site. Nothing in these Terms grants permission or entitlement to Restricted Territories users to access or use the Site.

4. **Unstaking Cooldown & Withdrawal Delay.** When you submit a request to unstake any digital asset through the Site, the applicable asset will remain locked for approximately seven (7) consecutive calendar days following the timestamp of your unstake request (the “**Cool-Down Period**”), and the actual duration may be longer due to factors outside the Foundation’s control, including blockchain confirmation times, network congestion, or third-party service availability. During the Cool-Down Period you will not be able to withdraw, transfer, or otherwise dispose of the unstaked asset via the Site, and any staking receipt token associated with that position may be restricted from redemption. Accrual or distribution of staking rewards with respect to the unstaked asset, if any, is not guaranteed during the Cool-Down Period and may cease once you initiate the unstake request. The Foundation may extend, pause, or re-start the Cool-Down Period if required by Applicable Law, network conditions, third-party service availability, or to preserve protocol integrity. You acknowledge and agree that the Foundation is not liable for any losses, opportunity costs, or foregone rewards arising from the Cool-Down Period or any extension thereof.

## 4. Identity Verification and Transaction Monitoring

1. We will collect user information in order to use certain features of the interface. This may include, without limitation, first and last name, X (formerly Twitter) handle, email, and wallet address. If you are unable to provide requested information, you may be prevented from accessing certain features. We will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this section.

2. You authorize us to make inquiries, whether directly or through third parties, that we consider necessary to verify your identity or protect you and/or us against fraud or other financial crime, and to act as we reasonably deem necessary based on the results of such inquiries. When we carry out these inquiries, you acknowledge and agree that your Personal Data may be disclosed to fraud prevention or financial crime agencies.

3. Your wallet address will be screened for regulatory compliance by a vendor when accessing the Site. By agreeing to these Terms, you are also agreeing to the terms and conditions and privacy policy of **Chainalysis** (or any successor wallet-screening vendor) when you access the Site. Any sharing of personal data between Liquidium and Chainalysis is governed by the Liquidium Privacy Policy.

4. Liquidium may review any necessary information to comply with applicable law and/or its internal compliance standards, including monitoring on-chain activity associated with your wallet. Liquidium may block certain transactions from being executed with the help of the interface if we determine, in our sole discretion, such transactions would violate applicable law or would otherwise not be permitted by these Terms.

5. Failure to provide any reasonably requested information pursuant to applicable money laundering and sanctions laws and regulations after you have become a user shall be grounds for the suspension of your account and/or termination of these Terms.

1. Parts of the Site may be inaccessible or inoperable from time to time for reasons including equipment malfunctions, maintenance, causes beyond our control, blockchain infrastructure issues, or third-party service outages.
2. There are risks related to the use of digital assets, including internet/software issues, malicious software, and the risk of bad actors accessing information stored in your compliant non-custodial wallet. You accept these risks and will not seek to hold the Foundation responsible for consequential losses.

6. The Foundation does not act as your agent.
7. To the fullest extent not prohibited by law, we owe no fiduciary duties or liabilities to you or any other party; to the extent any such duties or liabilities may exist at law or in equity, you hereby irrevocably disclaim, waive, and eliminate them.
8. The Foundation does not take custody or possession of digital assets, nor act as an agent or custodian for users. Purchases are conducted solely through the blockchain network governing the asset. Any digital asset transfers/payments are processed exclusively through the compliant non-custodial wallet you connect to the Site.

12. A lack of use or public interest in distributed ecosystems could hinder growth and reduce the utility or value of associated digital assets.
13. Digital asset prices and liquidity are highly volatile; fluctuations may materially and adversely impact the value and liquidity of digital assets available through the Site.
14. Smart contracts and related software may contain bugs, vulnerabilities, or misconfigurations that could result in partial or total loss of assets, failed transactions, or unintended protocol behavior. You **assume these risks**.

16. Advances in cryptography (including **quantum computing**) or breakthroughs in attack techniques may compromise cryptographic systems. You accept the risk that such advances may render digital assets or wallets insecure.
17. The protocol and interface may rely on **oracles and third‑party data/services** (e.g., node providers, indexing, price feeds). These may be unavailable, delayed, incorrect, or change without notice. We make **no warranties** regarding any third‑party data or services.

### 5.3 Covenants

As a condition to accessing or using the Site, you covenant to the Foundation that:

1. You will obey all Applicable Laws in connection with using the Site and will not use the Site if the laws of your country (or any other Applicable Law) prohibit you from doing so.
2. You may be required to pay a **Gas Fee** for each blockchain transaction. Under no circumstances will a transaction be invalidated, revocable, retractable, or otherwise unenforceable on the basis that the Gas Fee was unknown, too high, or unacceptable to you.
3. You understand that blockchain technology is new and presents novel legal issues. Regulatory authorities may disagree with the Foundation’s legal conclusions, and future laws or regulations could adversely impact blockchain technology, digital assets, and the **LIQUIDIUM Token**, including through transaction bans, new taxes, or prohibitions.

You may not settle or compromise any claim subject to this section without the Foundation’s prior written approval.

## 13. Disclosures; Disclaimers

1. The disclaimer of implied warranties herein may not apply to the extent such warranties cannot be excluded or limited under Applicable Law in your jurisdiction.
2. **AS IS / AS AVAILABLE.** THE SITE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS-IS” AND “AS-AVAILABLE” BASIS. THE FOUNDATION (AND OUR SUPPLIERS) EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM **ALL** WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, ACCURACY, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE (AND OUR SUPPLIERS) DO NOT WARRANT THE SITE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS; BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE; OR BE ACCURATE, RELIABLE, VIRUS-FREE, COMPLETE, LEGAL, OR SAFE. IF APPLICABLE LAW REQUIRES ANY WARRANTIES, THEY ARE LIMITED TO **NINETY (90) DAYS** FROM THE DATE OF FIRST USE.
3. **Digital Assets.** DIGITAL ASSETS, SUCH AS THE **LIQUIDIUM Token**, ARE INTANGIBLE AND EXIST ONLY THROUGH OWNERSHIP RECORDS ON THE RELEVANT BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK. ANY TRANSFER OF TITLE OCCURS ON THAT NETWORK’S DECENTRALIZED LEDGER. THE FOUNDATION DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT TRANSFERS OF TITLE OR RIGHTS FOR ANY DIGITAL ASSET WILL BE SUCCESSFUL OR THAT ASSOCIATED PAYMENTS WILL BE PROCESSED SUCCESSFULLY.
4. **No Securities; No Investment Offer.** Nothing on the Site or in any content constitutes an offer to sell, solicitation, or recommendation to buy or sell **securities** or any other regulated financial instrument. Use of the protocol does not create any ownership interest in the Foundation or any affiliate. Any tokens referenced are functional, on‑chain digital assets and **are not intended to be securities**. You should not expect profits from the efforts of the Foundation; any rewards or yields (if any) are algorithmic/protocol‑driven and **not guaranteed**.

## 14. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Foundation and its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, and licensors shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential damages arising out of or related to your use of the Site, including but not limited to: (a) loss of profits, revenue, business, data, or goodwill; (b) errors, interruptions, delays, or Site failures; (c) unauthorized access to or use of your account or data; (d) any action taken based on information provided through the Site; or (e) any other loss or damage arising out of your use of the Site. This limitation applies whether based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other theory, and regardless of whether the Foundation was advised of the possibility of such damages. The Foundation’s **total aggregate liability** to you for claims arising out of or related to these Terms shall be limited to the **fees paid by you to the Foundation in the twelve (12) months** preceding the event giving rise to the claim. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain exclusions or limitations; in such cases, liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by law.

## 15. Dispute Resolution & Arbitration

1. **Arbitration.** Any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to any of our products, these Terms, the Site, or any other acts or omissions for which you may contend that we are liable (including any question of arbitrability) (a “**Dispute**”), shall be finally and exclusively settled by arbitration under the **JAMS Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures** (including, where applicable, the **JAMS Mass Arbitration Procedures and Guidelines**). The arbitration shall be confidential before a single arbitrator selected pursuant to JAMS rules. The arbitration will be held in the **Cayman Islands**, unless we both agree to another venue. Unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate your claims with those of any other party. Any judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If for any reason a claim must proceed in court rather than in arbitration, you waive any right to a jury trial and agree such claim may be brought only in a court located in the Cayman Islands.
2. **Class Action Waiver.** TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN A PARTY’S **INDIVIDUAL** CAPACITY, **NOT** AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND THE FOUNDATION AGREE, NO ARBITRATOR OR JUDGE MAY CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS OR ENGAGE IN CLASS ARBITRATION. IF A COURT DECIDES THAT APPLICABLE LAW PRECLUDES ENFORCEMENT OF ANY LIMITATIONS IN THIS PARAGRAPH AS TO A PARTICULAR CLAIM FOR RELIEF, THEN THAT CLAIM (AND ONLY THAT CLAIM) MUST BE SEVERED FROM ARBITRATION AND MAY BE BROUGHT IN COURT. THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER DOES NOT IMPAIR THE FOUNDATION’S RIGHT TO CONSOLIDATE RELATED USER CLAIMS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.

## 16. Governing Law

The interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and any dispute related to these Terms or the Site, will be governed by and construed and enforced under the laws of the **Cayman Islands**, without regard to conflict-of-law rules or principles that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. We may initiate a proceeding related to the enforcement or validity of our intellectual property rights in any court having jurisdiction. For any other proceeding not subject to arbitration under these Terms, the courts located in the Cayman Islands will have **exclusive jurisdiction**. You waive any objection to venue in such courts.

## 17. General Information

1. **Electronic Communications.** You consent to receive all communications, agreements, documents, receipts, notices, and disclosures electronically (collectively, “**Communications**”) that we provide in connection with these Terms or the use of the Site. We may provide Communications by posting them on the Website or by emailing them to the address you provide. You should maintain copies by printing or saving electronic copies. You may contact us with questions, complaints, or claims concerning the Site at **info@liquidium.org**.
2. **Copyright & Marks.** Copyright © 2025 the Foundation. All rights reserved. All trademarks, logos, and service marks (“**Marks**”) displayed on the Website are our property or the property of third parties. You may not use these Marks without prior written consent from us or the applicable third party.

4. **Severability.** If any provision of these Terms is held unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.
5. **No Waiver.** No waiver by the Foundation of any term or condition set out in these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of the Foundation to assert a right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
6. **Assignment.** You may not assign, transfer, or sublicense any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent. We may assign or transfer our rights and obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, to any affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, without notice to you.
7. **Entire Agreement.** These Terms, together with any policies or documents incorporated by reference (including the Privacy Policy), constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and the Foundation regarding the Site and supersede all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications.
8. **Headings; Interpretation.** Section headings are for convenience only and do not affect interpretation. "Including" means "including without limitation".
9. **Survival.** Upon any termination or expiration of these Terms, the following Sections will survive and remain in full force and effect: 2 (Privacy Policy), 5 (Use of the Site) to the extent of accrued obligations, 6 (No Professional Advice or Fiduciary Duties), 7 (Prohibited Activity), 8 (Proprietary Rights), 11 (Accuracy of Information), 12 (Indemnification), 13 (Disclosures; Disclaimers), 14 (Limitation of Liability), 15 (Dispute Resolution & Arbitration), 16 (Governing Law), 17 (General Information), 18 (Additional Protocol Disclosures), and 19 (Force Majeure).

## 18. Additional Protocol Disclosures

1. **Transaction Creation, Confirmation, and Potential Rejection.** The Site may assemble partially signed transactions or similar payloads for your signature. Finalization and broadcast occur only after validation during a confirmation step. Transactions may be rejected, fail to broadcast, or fail to confirm for reasons including (without limitation): changes in exchange rates or protocol parameters; input/UTXO state changes (including lock contention or double-spend conflicts); third‑party service outages; network conditions; insufficient fees; wallet or user error. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Foundation disclaims responsibility and liability for losses arising from any failure, rejection, non‑broadcast, or non‑confirmation.
2. **Third‑Party Data and Services Reliance.** The Site may rely on third‑party data, infrastructure, and services (including without limitation mempool fee estimators, blockchain explorers, rune data sources, address/UTXO discovery tools, wallet providers, and hosting/CDN/analytics providers). Such third parties are not controlled by the Foundation and may be inaccurate, delayed, unavailable, or erroneous. The Foundation makes no warranties as to the availability, accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of any third‑party data or services and shall not be liable for any resulting losses.
3. **Exchange Rates, Yields, and Estimates.** Any exchange rates, yields, reward projections, or similar figures presented in the Interface are **variable**, may change without notice, and are provided **for informational purposes only**. They may be derived from protocol components and/or updated by automated processes or oracles on intervals. They are **not guarantees, promises, offers, or commitments**, and no APR/APY or performance is assured.
4. **Fee Estimates and Network Behavior.** Any suggested fees are **estimates**. Network congestion, replace‑by‑fee policies, and mempool dynamics can cause delays, replacements, or failures. You are solely responsible for selecting fees and for any consequences arising from fee selection, including overspending or too‑low fees that may result in delay or failure. The Foundation disclaims responsibility for confirmation timing or outcomes.
5. **Operational Change Rights.** Without limiting Sections 8 and 10, the Foundation may at any time **pause, modify, throttle, or discontinue** any features, parameters, or integrations; **migrate** smart contracts/canisters or supporting infrastructure; and implement **emergency measures** to preserve protocol integrity or comply with law. Changes take effect upon posting unless stated otherwise.
6. **Token Characterization (sLIQUIDIUM / STAKED•LIQUIDIUM).** sLIQUIDIUM (and any staking receipt or analogous token exposed via the Site) is intended to serve as a **staking receipt/utility token** representing protocol state for convenience within the ecosystem. It does **not** represent equity, debt, profit‑sharing, dividends, voting rights (unless expressly provided), or any ownership interest in the Foundation or its affiliates. Nothing herein constitutes an offer or solicitation to sell or purchase securities or any other regulated instruments, and no expectation of profits from the efforts of others is offered or implied. Users are solely responsible for ensuring their use complies with applicable laws in their jurisdiction.

## 19. Force Majeure

**Force Majeure.** The Foundation shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under these Terms to the extent such delay or failure is caused by an event or circumstance beyond the Foundation’s reasonable control, including but not limited to: acts of God; natural disasters; epidemics/pandemics; war, terrorism, civil unrest, or industrial disputes; acts or orders of government or regulators; embargoes or sanctions; failures or delays of power, telecommunications, internet, hosting, or other infrastructure providers; blockchain network failures, congestion, forks, or attacks; cyberattacks; and third‑party service outages. The Foundation’s obligations shall be suspended for the duration of the Force Majeure event and for a reasonable period thereafter.
