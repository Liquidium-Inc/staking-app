## 1. Information We Collect

1. **Collected Information.** We may collect **Personal Data** and **Anonymous Data** as described below. “**Personal Data**” means data that allows someone to identify you individually, including, for example, your name, address, email address, and any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing. “**Anonymous Data**” means data, including aggregated and de-identified data, that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data and does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual persons.

2. **Information You Provide Us.**

   1. **Account Information.** You may be required to have a user account to use the Site. When you use the Site, update your profile, create or update an account, or contact us, we may collect Personal Data such as email address, first and last name, username, and other information you provide. We may also collect your blockchain address, which may become associated with Personal Data when you use our Service. When blockchain addresses are processed for analytics or telemetry, we store only truncated representations consistent with **Section 1(3)(b)**.
   2. **User Preferences.** If a user account is created for you, the Site may let you store preferences (e.g., display options, notification settings, favorites). We may associate these choices with your blockchain address, browser, or mobile device.
   3. **User Communications.** If you provide feedback or contact us, we collect your name and contact information and any other content included in the message.
   4. **Other User-Provided Information.** We may also collect Personal Data at other points on our Site where you voluntarily provide it or where we state that Personal Data is being collected (e.g., purchases, surveys, newsletter subscriptions, or registrations).
   5. **Voluntary Nature.** Providing Personal Data is voluntary; however, you may not be able to use certain features of the Site if you choose not to provide it.
   6. **Keys and Secrets.** We **never** request, collect, store, or have access to your private keys, seed phrases, wallet passwords, or similar secret credentials. You should never share such credentials with anyone, including anyone claiming to be associated with the Foundation.

3. **Information Collected via Technology.**

   1. **Automatic Data Collection.** As you navigate and interact with the Site, we may use automatic data collection technologies to collect information about your equipment, browsing actions, and patterns.
   2. **Information Collected by Our Servers.** To provide the Service and make it more useful, we (or a third-party provider) may collect information including browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (“**IP**”) address, mobile device ID, blockchain address, wallet type, and date/time stamps. Where feasible, we pseudonymize these network identifiers before storing them (e.g., we truncate IP addresses and store only limited fragments of wallet addresses when processing analytics or quality metrics).
   3. **Log Files.** We gather certain information automatically and may store it in log files (e.g., IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (“**ISP**”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamps, clickstream data). We may use this information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user movements, and personalize the experience.
   4. **Cookies.** Cookies are small files placed on your device. Cookies help us analyze web traffic and recognize you, enabling personalization. We only activate analytics cookies (currently PostHog) after you explicitly opt in through our on-site consent banner or settings, and we configure those cookies to collect only pseudonymized telemetry (see **Section 1(3)(b)**). You can withdraw that consent at any time. Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but you can modify your browser settings to decline cookies (see **Section 8 – Your Choices**). Declining cookies or withdrawing consent may limit Site functionality.
   5. **Pixel Tags.** We use “**Pixel Tags**” (clear gifs, web beacons, or web bugs) to analyze how users find our Service, improve usefulness, and tailor experiences. Our systems do not currently recognize “do not track” signals or similar mechanisms.
   6. **Analytics Services.** Third-party analytics services (“**Analytics Services**”) may set their own cookies or similar tools when you grant consent. We presently rely on PostHog to compile reports on user activity. The information generated (“**Analytics Information**”) is transmitted to the Analytics Services, which compile reports on user activity for us (on an individual or aggregate basis). They may transfer information to third parties where required by law or where such third parties process Analytics Information on their behalf. Use and sharing of Analytics Information are governed by the Analytics Services’ terms of use and privacy policies. You can withdraw consent via the “Cookie Preferences” controls on the Site, after which analytics cookies will not be set.
   7. **Data Inventory (Illustrative, Non‑Exhaustive).** Depending on your interactions with the Site, we may process categories of data including: public blockchain data (e.g., blockchain addresses, transaction IDs, UTXOs, inscriptions), minimal HTTP request logs (e.g., IP address, user‑agent, referrer, timestamps), device and browser information, approximate geolocation inferred from IP, wallet type, and interaction metadata related to Site features. This list is **illustrative and not exhaustive**; we aim for data minimization consistent with security, operations, and compliance requirements.

4. **Information Collected from Third-Party Companies.** We may receive Personal Data and/or Anonymous Data about you from companies whose products or services are used in conjunction with our Site or linked from it (e.g., third-party wallet providers may provide your blockchain address and other information you choose to share with them). We may add this to data already collected through the Site.

5. **Public Information Observed from Blockchains.** We collect data from activity that is publicly visible and/or accessible on blockchains. This may include blockchain addresses and information regarding any blockchain-based interactions you have using the interface, which may then be associated with other data you have provided to us.

## 2. How We Use This Data

1. **Personal Data Use.** We process your Personal Data to run our business, provide the Site, personalize your experience, and improve the Site. Specifically, we use Personal Data to:

   - provide you with access to the Site;
   - enhance the Site;
   - improve functionality and user-friendliness;
   - provide customer support and respond to requests, inquiries, and feedback;
   - detect, prevent, and address fraud; enforce our terms or policies (including this Privacy Policy and the Terms); and address other harmful or unlawful activity;
   - send administrative notifications and security, support, and maintenance advisories;

## 3. How Long We Keep Your Data

We retain data as necessary to process requests, operate our business, provide the Site, or as long as legally required. For as long as we have your data, we will protect its privacy and security consistent with this Privacy Policy.

## 4. How We Protect Your Information

1. **Precautions We Take.** We implement reasonable physical, administrative, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of information collected through our Service. Access to personal information is restricted to authorized personnel and/or third-party providers as appropriate. Nevertheless, transmission via the internet is not completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the security of information about you.
2. **Your Responsibility.** If you create an account, you are responsible for keeping your credentials confidential. Do not share passwords or secret keys.
3. **No Guarantee.** Although we strive to protect personal information, we cannot guarantee its security during transmission. Any transmission is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of privacy settings or security measures on the Site.

## 5. How We Share Your Information

We disclose Personal Data as described below and elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.

1. **Third-Party Service Providers.** We may share Personal Data with service providers to provide technical infrastructure; conduct QA testing; analyze Site usage; prevent, detect, and respond to unauthorized activities; comply with regulations; provide technical and customer support; and otherwise support us and the Site. For example, we use PostHog to provide analytics. PostHog only receives pseudonymized telemetry from consenting users (e.g., truncated IP addresses, partial wallet identifiers) and processes that data subject to its own privacy commitments.
2. **Affiliates.** We may share some or all Personal Data with subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under our common control (“**Affiliates**”), which will be required to honor this Privacy Policy.
3. **Professional Advisors.** We may share information with our professional advisors for audits and compliance.
4. **Corporate Restructuring.** We may share Personal Data in connection with or during negotiation of mergers, financings, acquisitions, or dissolution transactions, or in insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership. If another company acquires the Foundation, business, or assets, it will possess the Personal Data and assume rights and obligations as described in this Privacy Policy.
5. **Legal Requirements.** We may share Personal Data to comply with court orders, laws, or legal processes, including responses to government or regulatory requests.
6. **Other Disclosures.** We may disclose Personal Data to fulfill the purpose for which you provide it, for any other purpose disclosed when you provide it, or with your consent.
7. **No Sale.** We do not sell or share your personal information with unaffiliated third parties for marketing purposes.

## 6. Links to Third-Party Websites

Our Site may contain links to third-party websites. When you click a link, you will leave our Site and another entity may collect Personal Data from you. We do not control and are not responsible for third-party websites or their content. This Privacy Policy does not apply to those websites or their data practices. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of every website you visit. Links are provided for convenience and do not signify endorsement.

## 7. Third-Party Wallets
